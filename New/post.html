                    Nakiri Ayame (百鬼あやめ) is a female Japanese Virtual YouTuber associated with hololive, debuting as part of its second generation of VTubers alongside Minato Aqua, Murasaki Shion, Yuzuki Choco and Oozora Subaru.

                    Ayame is an oni who seems to talk to humans as if they are below her. However in spite of this, she is very friendly, playful and treats her audience equally to herself. Even sometimes looking up to humans she respects such as Houshou Marine to where she had difficulties approaching her.

Ayame is infamous for her approachability and her rather sensitive funny bone, as it's very easy to make her let loose a cute little giggle from the slightest amusement. She will laugh when she's up to no good, chuckle at her observations on things, giggle at her mistakes and burst at her chat's cheap jokes. Bad Japanese puns are especially her weakness as she starts giggling and laughing to where she can't contain herself anymore, bashing her table uncontrollably and needing to stop whatever she's doing just to let it loose.

She can be very analytical of new people in a social context, often taking 5 separate encounters before she collects enough "data" to know how to approach someone, which can sometimes cause analytical meltdowns when around people who prefer to know someone ASAP (like Marine). Additionally, typical of an oni, she can also have a really violent temper if pushed too far as she got into a physical fight with her father and kicked a hole in the wall when someone deleted all of her cable recordings...again. But when streaming she always keeps herself in a fantastic enough mood to avoid showing her anger in front of her fans, save for cute toothless outbursts.

She greets her fans with "Konnakiri!"
